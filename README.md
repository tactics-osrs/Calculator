# Calculator
Light calculator made in AHK. open-source code written in Auto-Hotkey.
I've added comments next to each function so its easily navigated and read for learning and editing purposes.

.EXE run-able without AHK downloaded.
.AHK needs autohotkey to be ran as-is.
.AHK file can be edited (my code is open-source) with any notepad.
